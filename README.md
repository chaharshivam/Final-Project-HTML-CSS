# HTML-CSS Final Project!

Hi! this is my final project in the HTML-CSS track at [AltCampus](https://github.com/AltCampus).

# Collaborators

 - Shivam Chahar ([GitHub Profile](https://www.github.com/chaharshivam))
 - Shree Tejas Aithal ([GitHub Profile](https://www.github.com/badbrahmin))

## Tech-stack used:

We use most of the concepts we've studied in the last month here at [AltCampus](https://github.com/AltCampus): 
 - CSS Flex
 - CSS Grid
 - SASS/SCSS

## Instructions for collaboration

-   Clone the project and create a new branch out of  `develop`  that should be named as  `<your initials>-<name of section you are assigned>`  e.g.  `SC-footer`.
-   Do not make any changes in  `master`  or  `develop`.
-   Do not send PR's to  `master`. Send them to  `develop`.
-   Follow  `mobile-first`  approach to design the website.
-   Keep the  `classnames`  meaningful and avoid classname conflicts in CSS and write reuseable code.
-   In case of merge conflicts, compare your branch with  `develop`  and  `pull`  if necessary.
